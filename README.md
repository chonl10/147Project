# 147Project
This is my CS147 final project.
The goal of this project is to implement a security monitor which could notify the user when there is motion or sound detected. 
I connect PIR motion sensor and sound sensor to Arduino to detect motion and sound, print notification on LCD, and meanwhile, send the data to cloud using Wi-Fi ESP 8266.
